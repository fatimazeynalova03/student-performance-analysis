# Student Performance Analysis

## Project Description
This project explores how study habits and extracurricular activities influence student exam performance. Using SQL queries on the `student_performance` dataset, we uncover insights that can help students, teachers, and policymakers improve learning outcomes.

The dataset contains details about attendance, study hours, sleep, tutoring sessions, teacher quality, extracurricular participation, and exam scores.
